# Conditional Statements in Python

Conditional statements are a fundamental part of programming that allow you to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. In Python, you can use `if`, `elif` (short for "else if"), and `else` to create conditional statements.

## `if` Statement

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is `True`. If the condition is `False`, the code block is skipped.

`
## `elif` Statement

The `elif` statement allows you to check additional conditions if the previous `if` or `elif` conditions are `False`. You can have multiple `elif` statements after the initial `if` statement.





## `else` Statement

The `else` statement is used to specify a block of code to execute when none of the previous conditions (in the `if` and `elif` statements) are `True`.
